# Cloud Interview task

Hello! We're very happy you've decided to interview with us. This repository contains a technical task designed to assess your DevOps / Cloud engineering skills.

We’d like you to run a dockerized application on a virtual machine and investigate any problems by getting visibility into logs.

First, fork this repository to your account.

Specifically, we want you to do these things:
 * Deploy a fresh virtual machine or server using your preferred cloud provider
 * Deploy and run a container from [this image on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/leoht5/dockerised-hello/general) (it was built using the Dockerfile in this repository)
 * Fix any problems 

Remember: it's only a work sample, it doesn't have to be production-grade, it only needs to work.

Along with the existing code, include and push a NOTES.md file that goes over:
  1. A short summary of what you built, how it works, and the decisions you made to get there (or, alternatively, a diagram of the overall system)
  2. The URL to your server's public DNS or IP (whether the containerised app is working correctly or not)
  3. Any problems or errors you found, and your process to fix them
  4. What you would do or explore if you were actually deploying this to production

Then send us back the link to your fork including all of the above – thanks!
